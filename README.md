Real Estate Forecaster - Flask Starter Project
=====================================

Introduction
------------

This is a starter project for a web application that uses the Flask framework to predict the price of real estate properties based on various factors such as location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms. The project includes a simple user interface built using HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and a Python backend powered by Flask that provides data access and processing services.

Getting Started
---------------

To get started with the project, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository to your local machine using `git clone https://github.com/[Your-Username]/real-estate-forecaster.git`.
2. Navigate to the cloned directory and create a new virtual environment for the project using `python -m venv env` (assuming you have Python installed).
3. Activate the virtual environment using `source env/bin/activate` on Linux or macOS, or `env\Scripts\activate` on Windows.
4. Install the required packages for the project by running `pip install -r requirements.txt`.
5. Start the Flask development server by running `python app.py`.
6. Open a web browser and navigate to `http://localhost:5000/` to access the application.

Features
--------

The project includes several features such as:

* A simple user interface for entering property details (location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms)
* A prediction page that displays the predicted price based on the entered details
* A database connection to store and retrieve property data
* A machine learning model that uses logistic regression to predict prices

Database
---------

The project includes a basic SQLite database that stores property data. The database schema is as follows:

* `properties`: a table for storing property details such as location, size, number of bedrooms and bathrooms, and price
* `predictions`: a table for storing predicted prices based on the entered details

Machine Learning Model
---------------------

The project includes a simple machine learning model that uses logistic regression to predict prices. The model is trained using a subset of the data stored in the database. The model can be accessed and used as needed through the `/predict` endpoint.

API Endpoints
--------------

The application provides several API endpoints for interacting with the database and using the machine learning model:

* `POST /predict`: accepts a JSON object containing property details and returns a predicted price based on the entered details
* `GET /properties`: retrieves all properties stored in the database
* `GET /properties/:id`: retrieves a specific property by its ID
* `PUT /properties/:id`: updates a specific property in the database
* `DELETE /properties/:id`: deletes a specific property from the database

Contributing
------------

The project is open to contributions from the community. Please fork the repository, create a new branch and submit a pull request with your changes. All contributors must follow the guidelines outlined in the Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct.

The Real Estate Forecaster project is built using Flask, a Python micro web framework, and SQLite, a lightweight relational database. The machine learning model uses logistic regression to predict prices based on the entered details.
